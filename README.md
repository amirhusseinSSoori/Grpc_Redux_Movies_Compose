# GRPC(Redux_Movies_Compose)
Sometimes developers want to be different from other guys. This repository was created some years ago when I worked at the University of Sharif Now find time and update this and try to maintain the code when will find time. Yeah, Grpc, I remember when I heard this protocol, I hadn't worked with RestApi very well But Grpc is so much easier than Rest API in Android. Now I want to describe this repository with So many Technology like redux and Jetpack Compose and other things.

So first clone this repository for run in client Python Server  : https://github.com/M-CAP7AIN/gRPC-Python-Server and set your Ip in BaseIp in (Constance class in client)


object Constance {
    const val BaseIp = ""
    const val BasePort = 50051
    const val NoError ="NoError"
}
